                        <h2>How to Choose the Best Sock for Walking & Hiking.</h2>
                    </header>
                    <p>Pay attention to the material. Woolen socks on their own can sometimes be too hot and hold too much moisture and whilst synthetic socks can wick moisture there is nowhere for it to go inside your boot or shoe. A combination fibre mix featuring Merino or Enduro wool will provide good cushioning and also wick moisture away from the skin to help prevent blisters. With more than 100 years of knitting expertise, Bridgedaleâ€™s unique Fusion Technology blends synthetic and natural fibres to give you the best o both worlds and ensure the highest level of performance and comfort. My recommendation would be that unless you cannot wear wool, avoid socks made from cotton as they will hold moisture next to the skin with the potential to cause blisters.

                        <h2>Converged vs. Hyper-Converged Infrastructure Solutions</h2>
                    </header>
                    <p>Building a converged infrastructure in a corporate environment means more than just replacing a few network devices. It requires an entirely different way of looking at a company's network infrastructure and the kinds of IT staff needed to support it.
                        Traditional IT infrastructures were made up of the proverbial technology silos. They included experts in networking, storage, systems administration, and software. But much of that has changed over the past decade or so as virtualization has become a prominent technology tying networks and servers together.
                        Today's virtual environments can be likened to the ubiquitous smartphone. Smartphone users generally don't concern themselves with issues such as storage or systems management; everything they need is just an app. Similarly, storage management on converged infrastructure systems, such as EMC's VMAX family, are provisioned essentially as an app as well, says Colin Gallagher, director of product marketing for the VMAX family.
